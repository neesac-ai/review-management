1. Google Review Limitation: Understanding that Google won't accept pre-filled or AI-generated reviews automatically, which approach do you prefer?
- i understand the google limitation. but is it possible to open a template box beside google review form. template box will have ai generated review. user just click a button on the template box and review gets filled

2. Customer Context for AI: How will the AI generate relevant reviews?
- this can be set up for each client separately by providing the business context to AI. we can generate multiple templates for that specific clients and get approved by the client.

3. Business Type: What type of business is this for?
- we can have templates for each line of businesses.

4. QR Code System: How should QR codes be generated and managed?
- can we have all of the options
a) Single QR code for entire business (all customers use same link)
b) Unique QR codes per transaction/customer (track individual feedback)
c) Multiple QR codes per location/department


1. Are you okay with the copy-paste approach for Google reviews ?
- Yes, proceed with copy-paste solution (Option B above)

2. Tech Stack Preference:
- Full-stack web app (React/Next.js frontend + Node.js/Python backend + Database). I will share the auth screenshot, color combination, logo, etc.

3. AI Review Generation:
- Reviews will be generated based on specific keywords given by clients. Reviews content must be optimized from SEO perspective. We can have review generation playground. The system will ask keywords and number of reviews to be generated. backend AI model will take those keywords and generate SEO optimized reviews. Clients can select the reviews to be used by customer after QR code scan
